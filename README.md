### My Leetcode things 

Disclaimer: I don't like leetcode, I don't like this interviewing method either. I just truly believe that swe can't be judged against a 30 min window where they should be implementing a binary tree traversal. Can it be a filter ? Sure, but, can it give you a whole picture of the candidate you're interviewing? Highly doubt so.

I just re red the above paragraph and I sound a bit angry, might be, but trust me, I have my reasons, and I believe I can propose a new method of judging candidates. 

As someone with a little bit above 5yrs of experience more or less, I can't recall one single time I had to implement a full binary tree traversal. Or something along. Why ? There're many libraries made by (fact) super smart people, those github usernames with no picture and just a repo, that outperform any implementation out there. 

As a sr software engineer things you might be dealing with are, probably, IAM role issues over aws(or gcp), deadlocks, race conditions, making a concurrent script to fix production importing bluebird's `Promise.map` and checking what's the sweet spot for the `concurrency` parameter for not getting kicked of a third party API you might be needing to send a request to. Trust me, there's no scenario where you would be doing a `if (root.value)` kind of thing, unless you're doing some research.

Is this the current state of interviewing because of many developers on the market ? Or just because we started out thinking 

_- oh if google interviews this way, we should do the same (acme corp, 5 employees)_. 

A better approach should totally be, strictly speaking for positions that have a couple of years of experience in, talking about previous experiences, technologies used, trying to dig deep into the method of thinking _why did this candidate went with x instead of y_, and the tradeoffs that come with it. Most of the real world dev daily things are about tradeoffs, can we implement X inhouse ? Should we use the X-API implementation? What if a couple of months in we're vendor locked in (I'm trying not to use too much jargon tbh) and for some reason we need to change providers ?. 

That's, IMHO, a pretty good perspective and way of surfacing battle scars and oneself's way of thinking. 

Anyway, like bear grylls said, [improvise, adapt, overcome](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/improvise-adapt-overcome), so here're my average stabs at leetcode things, sometimes you'll be able to find better performant solutions over my [leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/bhflm/).
